                                Dr. Miller has 6 years of experience working with certified EVA flight controllers in Houston, Texas where he has gained operational insight and knowledge of the operational constraints of conducting human EVA, based on direct observation and interaction with subject-matter-experts. His research specifically focuses on advancing present-day tools, technologies and techniques to make them applicable for future deep-space EVA exploration as the EVA Operations System (EVA Mission System Software) product manager. He currently resides with JSC-XI and collaborates extensively with JSC-SK and other JSC/Ames/Goddard teams.

                                Leia Stirling is an Associate Professor in Industrial and Operations Engineering at the University of Michigan, a Core Faculty in the Center for Ergonomics, and an Affiliate Faculty in the Robotics Institute. Her research quantifies human performance and human-machine fluency to assess performance augmentation, advance exoskeleton control algorithms, mitigate injury risk, and provide relevant feedback to subject matter experts across domains. She received her B.S. (2003) and M.S. (2005) in Aeronautical and Astronautical Engineering from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and her Ph.D. (2008) in Aeronautics and Astronautics from MIT. She was a postdoctoral researcher at Boston Children’s Hospital and Harvard Medical School (2008-2009), on the Advanced Technology Team at the Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering (2009-2012), then an Assistant Professor at MIT (2013 – 2019). She joined the faculty at the University of Michigan in 2019.
