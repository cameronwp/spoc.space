                                Dr. Miller has 6 years of experience working with certified EVA flight controllers in Houston, Texas where he has gained operational insight and knowledge of the operational constraints of conducting human EVA, based on direct observation and interaction with subject-matter-experts. His research specifically focuses on advancing present-day tools, technologies and techniques to make them applicable for future deep-space EVA exploration as the EVA Operations System (EVA Mission System Software) product manager. He currently resides with JSC-XI and collaborates extensively with JSC-SK and other JSC/Ames/Goddard teams.
